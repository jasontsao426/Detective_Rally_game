Detective Rally,

I have been very dissapointed with your production at work latley. Your last success case was dated almost 3 years ago, and I am seriously considering relief
you from your duty. I like you Mr. Rally, but I can no longer have your back anymore. Nevertheless,  I've decided to give you a one last chance. A rich man
reported his pearl necklace had been stolen, and evidence suggested that it's somehere in the black market. Please trace it down and retrieve the necklace.
Don't let me down, for old time sakes.

Director Scully
